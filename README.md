# S.OS

> *Legacy of the One Who Knows No More*

Welcome to **S.OS** â€” a lightweight, minimal Linux distro hand-built for those who seek clarity, control, and clean performance.

This project is in early development. The goal is to create an ultra-lean system with zero bloat, built from the ground up using Tiny Core Linux as a base â€” but customized to the core with my own philosophy, design, and soul.

### Why S.OS?

Because sometimes, systems shouldn't just run.  
They should **remember**.  
This OS is more than code â€” itâ€™s **a tribute**, a tool, and a **testament**.

### Features (Planned)
- Lightweight CLI-first experience
- Custom boot, init, and system tools
- Optional GUI layer (future)
- No unnecessary dependencies
- Optimized for speed, silence, and customization

### Base
- Built on **Tiny Core Linux** 64-bit (CorePure64)
- Full manual build â€” no bloated distros, just Linux from near-scratch

### ðŸ–¤ Personal Note

> *This OS is dedicated to memory, pain, and preservation.*  
> *It is built for those who walk the ruins, and still want to build.*
