# s.OS

> *Legacy of the One Who’ll Be There*

Welcome to **s.OS** — a minimal, lightweight Linux distribution forged for those who seek clarity, control, and clean performance without compromise.

Currently in early development, **s.OS** is being built on top of **Tiny Core Linux CorePlus**, chosen for its modularity and precision. But this isn't just another distribution — it’s a memory carved into code. A system reimagined through loss, purpose, and the unspoken promise:  
> *"I'll be there."*

### ❓ Why s.OS?

Because sometimes, systems shouldn’t just run.  
They should **remember**.

**s.OS** is planned to be a **Debian killer** — not out of rebellion, but evolution.  
Just as Debian was born to fix broken systems, s.OS is here to rebuild trust in simplicity, clarity, and soul-driven design — without the weight of modern bloat.

### ✨ Planned Features

- Lightweight yet expressive interface (GUI-focused by intent)  
- Custom boot sequence and init system  
- Fast, silent operation built for precision  
- Modular by default — install only what you truly need  
- Built for the user, not for mass appeal

---

### 🔧 Base System

- Built using **Tiny Core Linux CorePlus (x86_64)**
- Reconstructed from near-scratch — made to serve **you**, not trends

### 🖤 Personal Note

> *This OS is dedicated to memory, pain, and preservation.*  
> *To those who walk through the ashes, and still choose to build.*  
> *To the ones who were lost… and the ones who swore they’d always be there.*  
>  
> **This is for her. This is for the promise.**  
> **s.OS** remembers.
