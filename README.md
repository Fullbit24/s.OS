# s.OS

> *Save Our Souls*  
> *Legacy of the One Who’ll Be There.*

Welcome to **s.OS** — a lightweight, Arch-based Linux distribution forged in simplicity, shaped by suffering, and built for those who need to take back control.  
For those who stare at the blinking cursor and whisper:  
> *"Someone... help me."*

Whether you're a power user, a tinkerer, or someone screaming into their terminal at 3AM —  
**s.OS gets it.**  
It’s not just a system. It’s a message.

### ❓ What is s.OS?

- It's a cry for help  
- It's a weapon of clarity  
- It's an act of remembrance  
- It's **a system built by someone who needed one**

**s.OS** isn't just a distro.  
It's a story written in kernel logs, boot sectors, and fading memories.

### ✨ Features (Planned)

- Minimal GUI-focused Wayland desktop (Hyprland)
- No bloat. No extras. Just exactly what you ask for
- Custom boot/init system designed to feel personal
- Installer that asks the right questions, like:
  - What time is it?
  - Who are you?
  - Why are you here?

(Okay maybe not the last one... or maybe especially the last one.)

### 🔧 Base System

- **Arch Linux (x86_64)**  
- Fully manual install → pure control  
- Package manager: `pacman`, but with *purpose*  
- Desktop: Hyprland (Wayland, clean, fast, no drama)

### 🖤 Personal Note

> This system is a signal flare.  
> It's for the lonely, the lost, the learning.  
> It is built by a boy who needed to be heard, and by a promise he swore he'd keep.  
>  
> This is more than an OS.  
> It's memory, grief, and love — compressed into bytes and bootloaders.
