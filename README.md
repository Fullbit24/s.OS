# s.OS

> *Legacy of the One Who Knows No More*

Welcome to **s.OS** — a lightweight, minimal Linux distro hand-built for those who seek clarity, control, and clean performance.

This project is in early development. The goal is to create an ultra-lean system with zero bloat, built from the ground up using Tiny Core Linux as a base — but customized to the core with my own philosophy, design, and soul.

### Why s.OS?

Because sometimes, systems shouldn't just run.  
They should **remember**.  
This OS is, planned to be the next debian **killer**, for the very reason debian was made

### Features (Planned)
- Lightweight CLI-first experience
- Custom boot, init, and system tools
- Optional GUI layer (future)
- No unnecessary dependencies
- Optimized for speed, silence, and customization

### Base
- Built on **Tiny Core Linux** 64-bit
- Just Linux from near-scratch made to work for **you**

### 🖤 Personal Note

> *This OS is dedicated to memory, pain, and preservation.*  
> *It is built for those who walk the ruins, and still want to build.*
