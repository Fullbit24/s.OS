# s.OS

> *Legacy of the One Who’ll Be There*

Welcome to **s.OS** — a minimal, expressive Linux distribution built atop the bleeding edge of Arch Linux. Designed for clarity, performance, and emotional permanence, s.OS isn't just another system.  
It’s a message embedded in every boot.  
A memory encoded in every line.  
A silent vow:  
> *"I'll be there."*

### ❓ Why s.OS?

Because some systems aren’t built to compete.  
They're built to **remember**.

**s.OS** is envisioned as a **Debian killer** — not to disrespect, but to transcend.  
Just as Debian rose to fix what was broken, s.OS rises to remind us why we build:  
To simplify. To reclaim control. To preserve what mattered — even when it hurts.

### ✨ Planned Features

- GUI-focused, lightweight Wayland desktop (Hyprland)
- Custom boot experience and minimal init
- Fast, quiet, and personal — no background noise
- Ultra-modular: install only what you need, nothing else
- Built for those who want to *understand* their system, not just use it

---

### 🔧 Base System

- Built on **Arch Linux (x86_64)**  
- Fully manual install — no distro fluff, just raw Linux
- Powered by `pacman`, configured by heart  
- Default system: **Hyprland**, `zsh`, and hand-picked minimal tools
